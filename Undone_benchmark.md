# Undone Benchmark for LLM

## Introduction

This document serves to clarify the current status of the benchmark for the Large Language Model (LLM) under evaluation. As of now, the benchmark is incomplete and not ready for formal reporting or analysis.

## Current Status

- **Benchmark Design**: The design phase of the benchmark is still in progress. Key performance indicators (KPIs) and evaluation metrics are being refined.
  
- **Data Collection**: The necessary datasets for benchmarking have not yet been fully gathered. Ongoing efforts are being made to source high-quality and relevant data.

- **Testing Procedures**: Formal testing procedures have not been established. Once the design and data collection are complete, a systematic approach to testing will be developed.

- **Results Compilation**: No results have been generated yet. Consequently, there are no findings or insights to report at this time.

## Next Steps

1. **Finalize Benchmark Design**: Complete the framework for what will be measured and how.
  
2. **Complete Data Collection**: Gather all required datasets to ensure a comprehensive evaluation.

3. **Establish Testing Protocols**: Create clear and replicable testing procedures.

4. **Execute Benchmarking**: Once the above steps are complete, begin the benchmarking process.

5. **Report Findings**: Prepare a detailed report once sufficient data and results are available.

## Conclusion

At this stage, it is crucial to recognize that the benchmark for the LLM is not yet completed. Stakeholders will be updated as progress is made, and a timeline for completion will be provided once the initial phases are finalized.
